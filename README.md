# ESlint Config
## Lets Learn an ESLint Rule

### Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI) is a feature in JavaScript that automatically adds semicolons in certain situations. While it offers flexibility in writing code without semicolons, it can lead to unexpected behavior. The debate is whether to always include semicolons manually for code clarity or rely on ASI. The importance of understanding ASI lies in preventing code errors and unexpected behavior, whether you use semicolons or not, to ensure consistent and reliable code execution. Linters like ESLint can help enforce coding standards and catch ASI-related issues.
